## inbox.todo
- multiple imputation for missing data wherein you define the population of all ward admissions and then perform MI for those where sites did not report data
	
## resume.todo
- priority is to get working_traj table up and running; issue is with cmp data … use tailsmini and pull from tailsFinal @done
- So it looks like pre-admission trajectory is unimportant for the majority of admissions, now examine post-admission trajectory in SwiFT: this provides a nice link and gives you a chance to discuss (SPOT)id. Would expect post-admission trajectory to have different meaning (response to treatment indicator)
	
## later.todo
- tailsMini is a compromise … need to produce a subset of CMP data that you genuinely need and code the field responses
- replace the '.' in dates with missing fields with an empty string
- index_table.py should not be case sensitive @done
- make_table.py is incredibly slow with datasets of 100k+ … 

# Logbook

- define working data for trip to Pittsburgh
121111
- SPOT trajectory work
	- need basic table: start from tailsFinal 
	- merge in headsFinal since this will bring outcome data
	
121112.todo
	- consort diagram data @done
	- define carefully delta IM using time @done
	- bring across IM prob @done
	- bring across individual variables @done
	- model build @done
- 121113.todo
	- convert from logistic model
	- examine within subgrps (pneumonia, septic shock, acute panc)
	- examine components of trajectory
		- P:F ratio
	
# Results

## Patients and population
### Inclusions
	- adult emergency ward admissions
	- Available population
		- 96 sites
		- 888 months
		- 14189 admissions
	- Inclusion: Initial quality criteria 
		- 59 sites
		- 564 months 
			- 8.7 months per site
		- 9329 admissions
	- Exclusion (on going quality checks): 
		- 57 sites
		- 465 months
		- 7678 admissions

### Exclusions
	- Counts below include those excluded in the last step above b/c of poor quality
	- 1234 + 25 reported by site to be ineligible: no bedside assessment
	- 741 re-admissions
	- 2213 missing survival status
	- 861 indirect ward to ICU admissions
	
### Final sample
	- 4763 (87 patients per site)
	- 54 sites
	- 454 months (8.4 months per site, 10 patients per month)
	- Median 10 patients per month (IQR 7-13) (Range 3-27)

# Discussion
## Telling the story
- Meaning of trajectory
- Why pre-admission trajectory will be 'different' 
- Collecting the data
	- Warning: this can only be used for those admitted: cannot interpret it to have meaning pre-admission since you did not observe trajectory in the non-admitted
- Trajectory as a univariate signal looks good
	- Across subgrps
	- Across components … maybe
		- weak relationship for P:F
		- no clinically relevant relationship for creatinine or urine
- Trajectory is correlated but not perfectly so with admission current value
- Punchline: But it does not work (overall)
## Meaning of trajectory

	- measurement error
	- clinical momentum
	- biological timing
	- response to treatment
